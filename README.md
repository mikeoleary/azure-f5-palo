# azure-f5-palo
Deploys a security stack where PaloAlto firewalls are internet-facing, and F5 BIG-IP's perform application services in a second tier. Uses marketplace (PAYG) images so that license keys or eval keys are not required, but production or long-term use cases can edit the templates as desired to use BYOL licenses and license keys.
